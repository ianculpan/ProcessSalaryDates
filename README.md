# ProcessSalaryDates
A demo symfony cli test

Will generate a 12 month data set of salary and bonus dates writtent to a csv file.

The git commit history is a little awry as I was relying on PHPStorm when it offered to add the files to the git repo.
This is a new development config and I had not created a key for PHPStorm to use.

Manually added and committed the files to complete the task.
